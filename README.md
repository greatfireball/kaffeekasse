# (German) Project Documentation 

The project "kaffeekasse" originated in the course "DIY - Self Fabrication" at
Friedrich-Alexander Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg during the winter term
2015/2016. This directory contains the German documentation that was handed in
as a part of the course requirements.
